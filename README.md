## Grassfire algorithm ##
In the context of robot path planning, the Grassfire algorithm can be used to compute a distance map that represents the distance of each grid cell in a grid-based map to the nearest obstacle or occupied cell. This distance map is then utilized to find an optimal path for the robot to navigate from a starting point to a goal point.

Here's how the Grassfire algorithm can be applied in robot path planning:

1. Input: Start with a grid-based map where each cell is either free or occupied by an obstacle. Set the occupied cells to a value representing the obstacle (e.g., -1) and the free cells to a high initial value (e.g., infinity).

2. Initialization: Create a distance map of the same size as the grid map, initially filled with the high initial values. Set the distance value of the obstacle cells to zero.

3. Iterative process: Perform a series of iterations until all cells have been processed.

   a. For each cell in the map, check its neighboring cells (usually 4- or 8-connected, depending on the allowed movement of the robot) and compute the minimum distance value among the neighboring cells.

   b. Update the distance value of the current cell in the distance map to be the minimum distance value obtained from step (a), plus one.

4. Repeat step 3 until all cells have been processed.

5. Output: The final distance map contains the computed distances from each cell to the nearest obstacle or occupied cell.

To find an optimal path for the robot, various path planning algorithms can be employed, such as A* (A-star) or Dijkstra's algorithm, utilizing the distance map generated by the Grassfire algorithm. These algorithms use the distance values as heuristic or cost functions to guide the search for the shortest path from the starting point to the goal point, while avoiding obstacles.

By incorporating the distance map into the path planning process, the robot can efficiently navigate through the environment, taking into account the proximity of obstacles and finding the most favorable paths based on the distances computed by the Grassfire algorithm.
